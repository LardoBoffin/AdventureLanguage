Install instructions

Windows Install

	This program requires .net core 3.1 (see below). I assume this limits it to Windows 7 upwards.

	Please do not use a folder path with spaces in the name below.

	1) Create a projects folder and program folder (e.g. C:\Users\lardo\Documents\AL\Projects and C:\Users\lardo\Documents\AL\Program) 
	2) Download the zip and extract it to the folder above. Ensure you have full permissions on the folder
	3) Install .Net Core 3.1 if not present (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/thank-you/runtime-3.1.2-windows-x64-installer)

	Create a new adventure project:

	1) Open up CMD
	2) Type in (change lardo for your name!)
		cd C:\Users\lardo\Documents\AL\Program to open the folder with the program
		type al -new C:\Users\lardo\Documents\AL\Projects Ransom
		and press enter (make sure the space is present between the folder path and project name).
	3) This should build the Ransom folder in your projects folder
	4) Open the AdventureData.xml in the Source folder and amend the following line:
		<BeebEmPath>C:\Program Files (x86)\BeebEm\BeebEm.exe</BeebEmPath>
		This needs to point to the folder where BeebEm is installed
		The tokeniser and make SSD program paths should point to your adventuyre language program path. 

	Building the adventure project:

	1) Open up CMD
	2) Type in (change lardo for your name!)
		cd C:\Users\lardo\Documents\AL\Projects\Ransom to open the folder with the build batch file
		type build and press enter

	Or just double click on the Build.Bat file in explorer.

Mac OSX

	This program requires .net core 3.1 (see below).
	This program also requires a tool to build the SSD file. I have used this one https://github.com/sweharris/MMB_Utils

	1) Download the zip and extract it to Documents. It may work elsewhere but I have no idea.

	Create a new adventure project:

	1) Open up Terminal
	2) Type in (change lardo for your log in name!)
		cd /Users/lardo/Documents/AL to open the folder with the program
		type dotnet al.dll -new /Users/lardo/Documents Ransom
		and press enter (make sure the space is present between the folder path and project name).
	3) This should build the Ransom folder in your Documents
	4) Open the AdventureData.xml in the Source folder and amend the following line:
		<SSDBuilder>/Users/lardo/Documents/Beeb</SSDBuilder>
		This needs to point to the folder where sweh's MMB utils are installed
		Still in this file amend the line:
		<BeebEmPath>/Applications/BeebEmMac/BeebEm4.app</BeebEmPath>
		This needs to point to BeebEm

	Building the adventure project:

	1) Type in the following changing your username from lardo
		cd /Users/lardo/Documents/AL to open the folder with the program and then-
		donet al.dll -b /Users/lardo/Documents/Ransom
	2) This should compile the program, build the SSD and run BeebEm
	3) Press cmd+W to unlock drive 0 (can't find a way to permanently change this setting) and then F0
	4) This should *exec the program to BASIC, save and then run the game

	There is also a Mac command batch file to run the build process - this is build.command in the root of the project folder. 
	If you double click this initially you will get an error about permissions. 
	In order to give yourself permissions to run this you need to do the following (with the caveat that I do not fully understand Mac security so have no clue what it is actually doing :D): -

	Open Terminal
	Type in chmod u+x /Users/lardo/Documents/######/build.command
	where ###### is the path to your project


General Notes

	Build Options

	Windows install only options:

	<Tokeniser> - this sets the location of the tokeniser file
	<TokenisedFileName> - this sets the final filename (once tokenised)
	<CrunchTokenisedFile> - set to Yes to crunch the outputted file. This will rename variables and procedures / functions to be as small as possible. Spaces will also be removed

	These are Windows only as I have not located a Mac based tokeniser program.

	Windows and Mac options:

	<SSDBuilder> - the path and EXE name of the program that will take the output files and build into an SSD image
	<SSDName> - the filename of the resultant SSD image.
	<BeebEmPath> - the full path and exe name of the installed BeebEm

	<BuildType> - 
	Debug mode, anything in source.txt prefixed with '-' will only be included in the end program if <BuildType>Debug</BuildType> is set.

	When starting in debug mode the option to run a walkthrough is present as number 3 in the menu when starting the game.

	Type the following into the 'What now' prompt when in debug mode. 

		*C 	show counters once
		*CON 	always show counters
		*COFF	switch off counters
		*WON	switch on parsed word numbers
		*WOFF	switch off parsed word numbers
